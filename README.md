## ðŸš€ Translation Service Setup

This app uses [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com/). To enable translation:

### Option 1: Use public API (requires free API key)
1. Get your key from [https://libretranslate.com](https://libretranslate.com)
2. Insert it in `translation_service.dart`:

```dart
static const String _apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
